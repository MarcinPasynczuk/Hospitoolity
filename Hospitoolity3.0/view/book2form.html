					<h1>COOKING</h1>
					<p>It is essential to cook food properly to kill any harmful
						bacteria. If it is not cooked properly, it might not be safe for
						your customers to eat.</p>
					<p>It is essential to cook food properly to kill any harmful
						bacteria. If it is not cooked properly, it might not be safe for
						your customers to eat. It is also very important to handle
						ready-to-eat food carefully to protect it from harmful bacteria.
						This is because it will not be cooked or reheated before serving.
						Do not forget that cooking does not remove allergens from food, so
						you need to handle food that contains allergens carefully. This
						section includes information on cooking safely, foods that need
						extra care, reheating, hot holding and ready-to-eat food.</p>

					<h3>COOKING SAFELY</h3>
					<p>Thorough cooking kills harmful bacteria.</p>
					<h3>SAFETY POINT & WHY?:</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Where appropriate, follow the manufacturer's cooking
							instructions for food products. The manufacturer has tried and
							tested safe cooking methods specifically for its products.</li>
						<li>Preheat equipment such as ovens and grills before
							cooking. If you use equipment before it has preheated, food will
							take longer to cook. This means that recommended cooking times in
							recipes or manufacturer's instructions might not be long enough.</li>
						<li>Do not let raw food touch or drip onto cooked food e.g.
							when adding food to the grill/barbecue. Never use the same
							utensils, plates or containers for raw and cooked or ready-to-eat
							food.</li>
						<li>It is a good idea to fully cook poultry in an oven first,
							then finish it on the barbecue.</li>
						<li>If you are using left over marinade as a sauce, make sure
							it is cooked until steaming hot. Raw food can carry harmful
							bacteria, which could spread onto cooked food and stop it being
							safe.</li>
						<li>This will make sure that the poultry is cooked
							thoroughly. Juices should be clear, with no pink or red in them.</li>
						<li>Marinades can carry bacteria from the raw meat or
							poultry, if not cooked thoroughly.</li>
						<li>If you serve beef or lamb rare (whole cuts such as steaks
							and whole joints only), make sure all of the outside surfaces are
							fully cooked, e.g. by sealing in a pan.</li>
						<li>This will kill harmful bacteria on the outside of the
							meat.</li>
						<li>Pork and rolled joints should not be served rare.</li>
						<li>Liver and offal, including dishes such as liver pate or
							parfait, must be cooked to a safe temperature in the centre of
							the meat (see 'Prove it').</li>
						<li>Harmful bacteria can be found in the centre of liver as
							well as the outside.</li>
						<li>Turn meat and poultry during cooking. This helps it cook
							more evenly and thoroughly.</li>
						<li>Make sure liquid dishes, e.g. gravy, soups, sauces and
							stews, are simmering and stir them frequently.</li>
						<li>This is to make sure the food is hot enough to kill
							bacteria. Stirring will help make sure the food is the same
							temperature all the way through.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>CHECK IT – USE THESE CHECKS TO TELL IF FOOD IS PROPERLY
						COOKED.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Check whole birds are cooked to a safe temperature in the
							thickest part of the leg (see 'Prove it'). The meat should not be
							pink or red and the juices should be clear.</li>
						<li>The largest piece of meat in stews, curries etc. should
							be cooked to a safe temperature in the centre with no pink or red
							(see 'Prove it').</li>
						<li>Check whole cuts of pork and processed meat products,
							such as sausages and burgers, are cooked to a safe temperature in
							the centre with no pink or red (see 'Prove it').</li>
						<li>Check combination dishes (e.g. contains meat and
							vegetables) are cooked to a safe temperature in the centre (see
							'Prove it'). If you are cooking a large dish or batch, check in
							several places.</li>
						<li>Stir liquid dishes regularly and check they bubble
							rapidly and are heated to a safe temperature in several places
							before serving (see 'Prove it').</li>
						<li>Check that all the outside surfaces of whole cuts of meat
							and whole joints (beef or lamb) are fully cooked.</li>
						<li>Check fish is cooked to a safe temperature in the centre
							and the colour and texture has changed (see 'Prove it'). Some
							fish (e.g. tuna) may be served 'rare' as long as they have been
							correctly frozen beforehand to kill any parasites which may be
							present and are fully seared on the outside to kill any harmful
							bacteria that may be present. Further guidance is available at
							the FSA website</li>
						<li>Check pork joints or rolled meat joints are cooked to a
							safe temperature in the centre (see 'Prove it'). The juices
							should not have any pink or red</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>PROVE IT</h3>
					<p>Use a disinfected temperature probe to check dishes are
						properly cooked or reheated. Examples of safe time/temperature
						combinations for cooking include: 80C for at least 6 seconds, 75C
						for at least 30 seconds, 70C for at least 2 minutes, 65C for at
						least 10 minutes, 60C for at least 45 minutes.</p>

					<p>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG:</p>
					<p>Cook the food for longer. Speed up the cooking process, for
						example by dividing the food into smaller quantities, or using
						different equipment.</p>
					<p>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN:</p>
					<p>Review your cooking method. You might need to increase the
						time or temperature, or use different equipment. Train staff again
						on this safe method. Improve staff supervision. Repair or replace
						equipment.</p>

					<h1>FOODS THAT NEED EXTRA CARE</h1>
					<p>Some foods need to be treated with extra care to make sure
						they are safe to eat. Remember that raw food is often the main
						source of bacteria in the kitchen. Follow the advice in the
						'Cooking safely' safe method on how to cook these foods. You
						should also take care with the following foods.</p>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Eggs:</p>
					<p>Cook eggs and foods containing eggs thoroughly until they
						are steaming hot or, if serving eggs or egg dishes lightly cooked
						(e.g. soft boiled or in fresh mayonnaise or mousse), either use
						pasteurised egg or British Lion code or equivalent assurance
						scheme. Make sure you rotate stock and use the oldest eggs first.
						Use eggs within the 'best before' date. You can freeze them for
						use later if required. Buy eggs from a reputable supplier. Store
						eggs in a cool, dry place.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Eggs can contain harmful bacteria. If you cook them
						thoroughly this kills any bacteria. The British Lion code or
						equivalent assurance schemes demonstrates eggs have been produced
						in a safe manner and therefore can be eaten less than thoroughly
						cooked. Pasteurisation also kills harmful bacteria. Harmful
						bacteria can grow in eggs that are not handled or stored correctly</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Please prove list the dishes containing eggs that you
							prepare or cook. Do you cook eggs and food containing eggs
							thoroughly until they are steaming hot? If not, what do you do? </b>
					</p>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Rice:</p>
					<p>When you have cooked rice, make sure you keep it hot until
						serving or chill it down as quickly as possible and then keep it
						in the fridge. You can make rice chill down more quickly by
						dividing it into smaller portions, spreading it out on a clean
						tray, or running it under cold water (make sure the water is clean
						and drinking quality).</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Rice can contain spores of a type of harmful bacteria that
						may not be killed by cooking or reheating. If cooked rice is left
						at room temperature, spores can multiply and produce toxins that
						cause food poisoning. Reheating will not get rid of these.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>How do you keep rice hot before serving? If you chill down
							rice how do you do this? </b>
					</p>
				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test49}">

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Pulses:</p>
					<p>Follow the instructions on the packaging on how to soak and
						cook dried pulses, such as beans.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Pulses can contain natural toxins that could make people ill
						unless they are destroyed by the proper method of soaking and
						cooking. Tinned pulses will have been soaked and cooked already.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b> Do you follow the manufacturer's instructions when cooking
							pulses? If not, what do you do? </b>

				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Shellfish (molluscs and crustaceans)</p>
					<p>Make sure you buy shellfish from a reputable supplier. Keep
						the product label for 60 days, after opening. Crabs, crayfish,
						lobster and scallops should be prepared by someone with specialist
						knowledge. Crustaceans and molluscs such as prawns and scallops
						will change in colour and texture when they are cooked. For
						example, prawns turn from blue-grey to pink and scallops become
						milky white and firm. Langoustines (also called scampi or Dublin
						Bay prawns) are pink when raw and the flesh becomes firm and
						pink-white when they are cooked. Always follow the manufacturer's
						instructions for preparation and storage. Before cooking mussels
						and clams, throw away any with open or damaged shells. To check
						that a mussel or clam is cooked, make sure the shell is open and
						that the mussel or clam has shrunk inside the shell. If the shell
						has not opened during cooking, throw it away. Fish: Make sure you
						buy fish from a reputable supplier. If you buy fresh fish make
						sure you store it between 0C and 4C. If you buy frozen fish then
						keep it frozen until you are ready to use it.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Some parts of these shellfish cannot be eaten and some are
						poisonous, so it is important to know how to remove these parts
						safely. If the shell is damaged or open before cooking, the
						shellfish might not be safe to eat. Certain types of fish, such as
						mackerel, tuna, anchovies and herrings, can cause food poisoning
						if not kept at the correct temperature.</p>
					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b> If you prepare crabs, crayfish, lobster and scallops, are
							these prepared by someone with specialist knowledge? If not, what
							do you do? Prove list the types of shellfish you serve or use as
							an ingredient. </b>
					</p>

				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test51}">

				<label>
					<p>Other foods that need extra care:</p>
					<p>Some businesses produce certain foods or use certain
						processes other than those included in this pack (some examples
						are provided below). If this is the case for your business, you
						must be able to demonstrate that you do these safely. Contact your
						the Environmental Health Team at your local council for additional
						guidance.</p>
					<p>Example processes include: Vacuum packing, sous vide, low
						temperature cooking, fermenting, smoking or curing meat/fish</p>
					<p>Example foods include: Kebabs, sushi/sashimi, liver parfait,
						fish/meat carpaccio and tartare, less than thoroughly cooked
						burgers</p>

					<h1>REHEATING:</h1>
					<p>It is very important to reheat food properly to kill harmful
						bacteria that may have grown since the food was cooked.</p>
					<p>
						<b>SAFETY POINT:</b> Make sure you use equipment that
						reheats/cooks food effectively and follow the equipment
						manufacturer's instructions. If equipment is not suitable for
						reheating, or is not used properly, the food might not get hot
						enough to kill bacteria.
					</p>
					<p>Preheat equipment such as ovens and grills before reheating.
						Food will take longer to reheat if you use equipment before it has
						preheated. This means that recommended reheating times in recipes
						or manufacturer's instructions might not be long enough.</p>
					<p>If you are reheating food in a microwave, follow the product
						manufacturer's instructions, including advice on standing and
						stirring. If you use a microwave to reheat food that you have
						cooked yourself, it is a good idea to stir it at stages while
						reheating. The manufacturer has tested its instructions to make
						sure that products will be properly reheated. Standing and
						stirring are part of the process of cooking/ reheating in a
						microwave and help make sure the food is the same temperature all
						the way through.</p>
					<p>When food is microwaved, it can be very hot at the edges and
						still be cold in the centre – stirring helps to prevent this.</p>
					<p>Serve reheated food immediately, unless it is going straight
						into hot holding. If food is not served immediately, the
						temperature will drop and harmful bacteria could grow.</p>
					<p>
						<b>THINK TWICE:</b> Remember, reheating means cooking again, not
						just warming up. Always reheat food thoroughly until it reaches a
						safe temperature in the centre (see 'Prove It' in 'Cooking
						Safely'). You should only reheat once. Do not put food into hot
						holding without reheating it properly first.
					</p>
					<p>CHECK IT:</p>
					<p>Check dishes reach a safe temperature in the centre (see
						'Prove it' in 'Cooking Safely'). When checking microwaved foods,
						test in a number of different areas in case of cold spots.</p>

					<p>
						<b>If you use a different check, you will need to prove that
							it is safe. See the 'Prove it' safe method in the Management
							section. Give details of your check here: </b>

					<h1>SAFE METHOD: ACRYLAMIDE</h1>
					<p>It is important not to over-cook certain foods.</p>
					<p>
						<b>WHAT IS ACRYLAMIDE:</b> Acrylamide is a chemical that is formed
						naturally when some foods are cooked at high temperatures (above
						120⁰C) such as by frying, roasting, baking, grilling and toasting.
						Legislation is in place to reduce acrylamide levels in food, as it
						has the potential to cause cancer in humans.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>WHAT FOODS:</b> If you cook the following types of foods, you
						should put in place practical steps to reduce acrylamide.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Raw potato products such as chips, French fries, other
							cut (deep-fried) and sliced potato crisps made from fresh
							potatoes, including potatoes that are deep fried and finished in
							the oven.</li>
						<li>Bread products such as loaves, bread rolls and baguettes,
							toast and toasted sandwiches.</li>
						<li>Sweet bakery products such as cookies, biscuits, scones,
							gingerbread, wafers, crumpets.</li>
						<li>Savoury bakery products such as crackers, crisp bread,
							breadsticks.</li>
					</ul>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Purchasing, receipt and storage</p>
					<ul>
						<li>When buying raw potatoes ask your supplier for advice on
							the best variety to use for the type of cooking you are doing.
							Certain potato varieties are lower in natural sugars and using
							these will help to keep acrylamide levels lower.</li>
						<li>Store raw, unpeeled potatoes that are going to be fried,
							baked or roasted in a cool, dark place, above 6⁰C. Do not store
							in the fridge. Potatoes stored in the fridge can form more
							sugars, which can mean higher levels of acrylamide when the food
							is cooked.</li>
						<li>When buying cooked products from a supplier tell them you
							will not accept over-baked or burnt products. Check deliveries
							and reject products that are over-baked or burnt as these will
							have higher levels of acrylamide.</li>
						<li>Ask your cooking oil supplier for advice on the best oil
							to use for the type of cooking you are doing. Cooking foods in
							the right oil for the type of cooking will help foods to fry
							quicker and keep acrylamide levels lower.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Preparation</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cut foods, such as potatoes, to similar sizes. This will
							help all foods to cook more evenly.</li>
						<li>Where possible, when making home-made chips, or cut
							potatoes that are going to be deep-fried, follow one of these
							steps: Soak (for 30–180 mins) in cold water after cutting. Rinse
							with clean water and drain. These steps will remove excess sugars
							and help to keep acrylamide levels lower. Or - Soak for a few
							minutes in warm water. Rinse with clean water and drain. Or -
							blanch potatoes before cooking.</li>
						<li>Where possible, and when the preparation process allows,
							when making bread or dough products follow this step: Extend the
							yeast fermentation time. This will help to keep acrylamide levels
							lower in the finished product.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Food Standards Agency l Further information:
						www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/acrylamide</p>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Cooking</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cook foods to a golden yellow, or lighter colour</li>
						<li>Where appropriate, follow the manufacturer's cooking
							instructions for food products. The manufacturer has tried and
							tested cooking methods specifically for its products.</li>
						<li>Deep-fry potato products, such as chips and French fries
							to a golden yellow, or lighter colour. The oil temperature for
							cooking should ideally be below 175⁰C. Cooking to a golden
							yellow, or lighter colour, and deep-frying at lower temperatures
							will keep acrylamide levels low.</li>
						<li>When deep-frying take care not to over-fill baskets. Fill
							the basket only half way. This will help the foods to cook more
							evenly.</li>
						<li>Keep cooking oil quality at its best by skimming often to
							remove crumbs and food particles left in the oil. This will
							prevent crumbs and food particles left in the oil from burning
							and will keep the oil quality for longer.</li>

						<li>Filter, change oils and clean cooking equipment as often
							as needed or as recommended by suppliers. Reusing old, dirty oil
							and cooking equipment will increase the levels of acrylamide in
							deep-fried foods.</li>
						<li>When baking bread and sweet or savoury bakery products
							cook to a golden yellow, or lighter colour. Use the lowest oven
							temperature possible for the food. Baking foods to a golden
							yellow, or lighter colour, and at lower oven temperatures will
							reduce acrylamide levels.</li>
						<li>When cooking foods such as toast and toasted sandwiches
							do not over-toast or burn. Cooking bread to a golden colour, or
							lighter, will help to keep acrylamide levels lower.</li>
						<li>Where possible, set a timer to mark the cooking time.
							This could be on the oven or fryer or you can use a separate
							timer. This will remind you to remove foods at the right time to
							prevent foods from becoming over-cooked or burnt.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>THINK TWICE! Over-cooking or burning certain foods means
						that these foods can be higher in acrylamide.</p>
					<p>Colour charts</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Some suppliers have produced colour charts to show what
							colour is the best for certain foods to keep acrylamide levels
							low. You can ask if your supplier has these available. You do not
							have to use colour charts, but they can be useful for training

					<ul>
						<li>This sheet is for you to show how you check key cooked
							dishes. It focuses on types of dish where proper cooking is
							essential to kill harmful bacteria. Before you start, make sure
							you have read the 'Cooking safely' and 'Foods that need extra

					<h1>HOT HOLDING:</h1>
					<p>It is very important to keep food hot until serving to
						prevent harmful bacteria from growing.</p>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>If you need to keep food hot before serving, you should use
						suitable equipment.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>It is difficult to hold food at a consistent, safe
						temperature without suitable equipment.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do you hot hold? What equipment do you use? </b>
					</p>


				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test2}">

				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Preheat hot holding equipment before you put any food in it.
						Food must be cooked thoroughly and steaming hot before hot holding
						begins.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Putting food into cold equipment means it might not be kept
						hot enough to stop harmful bacteria growing. Hot holding equipment
						is for hot holding only. It should not be used to cook or reheat
						food.</p>

					<p>If you offer food deliveries, make sure the food is kept hot
						or cold until it is collected by the delivery driver or customer.
						Also make sure food is kept hot or cold during delivery until it
						arrives at the customer's home. It is a good idea to use an
						insulated bag or box to transport food and make sure it stays
						covered until delivered.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>

					<p>THINK TWICE!:</p>
					<p>Hot food must be kept at 63C or above, except for certain
						exceptions. When you display hot food, e.g. on a buffet, you
						should use suitable hot holding equipment to keep it above 63C. If
						this is not possible, you can take food out of hot holding to
						display it for up to two hours, but you can only do this once.
						Food that has not been used within two hours, should either be
						reheated until it is steaming hot and put back in hot holding or
						chilled down as quickly as possible to 8C or below. If it has been
						out for more than two hours throw it away. Remember to keep the
						food at a safe temperature until it is used. If you do take food
						out of hot holding to display it, remember not to mix new food
						with the food that is already on display. This could lead to the
						older food being left out for too long.</p>

					<p>CHECK IT:</p>
					<p>Once it is cooked, keep food at 63C or above until it is

					<p>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG:</p>
					<p>If a dish is not hot enough at any point during hot holding:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>reheat it until it is a safe temperature and put back
							into hot holding (you should only do this once), or</li>
						<li>chill down the food safely (see the 'Chilling down hot
							food' safe method in the Chilling section) and reheat it later
							before serving.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you cannot do either of these things, throw the food
						away. Remember some foods need extra care. See the 'Foods that
						need extra care' safe method.</p>
					<p>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check your equipment is working correctly.</li>
						<li>Review your hot holding safe method. Try using a higher
							temperature setting or smaller quantities of food.</li>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>PROVE IT:</p>
					<p>Use a disinfected temperature probe to prove your method
						keeps food at a safe temperature of 63C or above. (See the 'Prove
						it' method in the Management section for advice on using probes
						safely). Write down what went wrong and what you did about it in
						your diary.</p>
					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<h1>READY-TO-EAT FOOD:</h1>
					<p>It is important to handle ready-to-eat food safely to
						protect it from harmful bacteria and allergens.</p>
					<p>Ready-to-eat food is food that will not be cooked or
						reheated before serving. This includes salads, cooked meats,
						smoked fish, desserts, sandwiches, cheese and food that you have
						cooked in advance to serve cold.</p>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>When preparing and handling food, you should keep
						ready-to-eat food completely separate from raw meat, poultry,
						fish, eggs and unwashed vegetables, make sure work surfaces,
						chopping boards, knives etc. are clean (and disinfected if you
						have prepared raw food), ideally, use separate colour coded
						chopping boards and utensils for ready-to-eat food, keep
						ready-to-eat food covered at all times during preparation and
						storage. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to store
						and prepare the food, if these are available.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This protects food from harmful bacteria and allergens. This
						is especially important for ready-to-eat food because it will not
						be cooked or reheated before serving. It also helps keep allergens
						from spreading. The manufacturer's instructions are designed to
						keep the food safe.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>List the types of ready-to-eat food you use and how you
							handle them. Are you confident that you do this for all
							ready-to-eat food where instructions are available? </b>
					</p>

				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test6}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>When preparing fruit, vegetables and salad ingredients peel,
						trim, or remove the outer parts, as appropriate, wash them
						thoroughly by rubbing vigorously in a bowl of clean water, wash
						the cleanest ones first. Wash your hands before and after handling
						fruit and vegetables. If you have prepared vegetables that have
						dirt or soil on the outside, clean and then disinfect chopping
						boards and work surfaces before preparing other food.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>The dirt on vegetables and salad ingredients can contain
						harmful bacteria. Peeling and washing helps to remove the dirt and
						bacteria.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do you do this? If not, what do you do? </b>
					</p>


				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test7}">
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<label>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Make sure you keep ready-to-eat food cold enough. See
						'Chilled storage and displaying chilled food' in the Chilling
						section. Do not use ready-to-eat food after the 'use by' date, if
						there is one. For food you have prepared, or removed from its
						original packaging, use stickers or another method to keep track
						of when food should be used by or thrown away. For guidance on how
						long to keep food once prepared or opened, follow manufacturer's
						storage instructions on the original product label. High risk
						ready-to-eat foods should be kept for a maximum of 3 days in total
						(day of cook/opening + 2) unless you have evidence that it is safe
						to keep them for longer. Cooked rice should only be kept for 1 day
						once prepared. If you slice cooked meat follow the manufacturer's
						instructions when you clean the slicer and avoid handling the meat
						as much as possible – use clean tongs or slice meat straight onto
						a plate.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>If these types of food are not kept cold enough, harmful
						bacteria could grow. You should never use food that has passed its
						'use by' date because it might not be safe to eat. Meat slicers
						need careful cleaning and disinfecting to prevent dirt building up
						and to stop harmful bacteria growing, in particular on the slicing
						blade. Hands can easily spread harmful bacteria onto food.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do you do this? If not, what do you do? Are staff trained
							how to clean the meat slicer properly, or supervised? </b>

					<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If you think that a food delivery has not been handled
							safely, reject the delivery.</li>
						<li>If ready-to-eat vegetables, fruit or salad ingredients
							have not been washed properly, wash them following the advice on
							the first side of this Safe method and clean any work surfaces
							etc. they have touched.</li>
						<li>If ready-to-eat food has been prepared on a work surface
							or with a knife that has been used for raw meat, poultry, fish,
							eggs or unwashed fruit and vegetables, throw the food away.</li>
						<li>If ready-to-eat food has not been chilled safely, throw
							the food away.</li>
						<li>If ready-to-eat food is past it's use-by date, throw it
							away.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If you do not think a supplier handles food safely,
							consider changing to a new supplier.</li>
						<li>Review the way you receive deliveries.</li>
						<li>Review the way you store and prepare ready-to-eat food.</li>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>THINK TWICE!</h3>
					<p>You should not use the same equipment, such as vacuum
						packing machines, slicers and mincers, for both raw and
						ready-to-eat food. These are complex pieces of machinery with lots
						of moving parts and it is very difficult to clean them
						sufficiently, so bacteria from raw food could easily be
						transferred to ready-to-eat food.</p>
					<p>If you are preparing both raw and ready-to-eat food, you
						should make sure where possible this is done in separate clean and
						disinfected areas. If this is not possible, surface and utensils
						used must be thoroughly cleaned and then disinfected between
						tasks.</p>
					<p>Make sure staff wash their hands thoroughly between tasks,
						especially when working with raw and ready-to-eat food. This stops
						bacteria and allergens being spread onto foods, surfaces and
						equipment.</p>

					<h3>PROVE IT</h3>
					<p>You may like to use a disinfected temperature probe to prove
						your methods are safe. You can record details of these checks in
						the Prove It: Records section.</p>

					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<p>Cooking and reheating</p>

					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>The 'Cooking safely' and 'Reheating' safe methods in the
						Cooking section tell you how to check food is thoroughly
						cooked/reheated. If you do a different check then you will need to
						prove it is safe. The food is safe if it has reached a high enough
						temperature for a long enough time.</p>

					<p>HOW TO DO IT:</p>
					<p>If you want to check the temperature of a food, use a
						disinfected probe. Insert the probe so the tip is in the centre of
						the food (or the thickest part). Examples of safe time/temperature
						combinations are listed in the 'Cooking safely' safe method.</p>


					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<p>Hot holding</p>

					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>To check food in hot holding is at or above 63C, use a
						clean, disinfected probe. Insert the probe so the tip is in the
						centre of the food (or the thickest part).</p>

					<p>HOW TO DO IT:</p>
					<p>The 'Hot holding' safe method in the Cooking section tells
						you how to hot hold safely. It is a legal requirement that hot
						food must be kept at or above 63C.</p>


					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<p>Chilling down hot food</p>

					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>The 'Chilling down hot food' safe method in the Chilling
						section tells you how to chill down hot food safely. Sometimes
						there might be more than one way of chilling down hot food that is
						suitable for what you are doing. You might want to compare
						different options to find out which is most effective. Compare
						different chilling options by trying them out with the same food.
					</p>

					<p>HOW TO DO IT:</p>
					<p>When you have just cooked the food, test its temperature at
						the centre (or thickest part) with a clean, disinfected probe.
						Start to chill it using one option and test the temperature again
						at regular intervals to see how quickly it is dropping. Repeat
						this with other options to see which is fastest.</p>


					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<p>Chilled storage and displaying chilled food</p>

					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>The 'Chilled storage and displaying chilled food' safe
						method tells you how to keep food cold. It is a legal requirement
						in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recommended in
						Scotland, that certain chilled foods must be kept at 8C or below.
					</p>

					<p>HOW TO DO IT:</p>
					<p>To check food is at 8C or below, use a disinfected probe.
						Insert the probe so the tip is in the centre of the food (or the
						thickest part).</p>


					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<p>Freezing</p>

					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>The Freezing safe method in the Chilling section tells you
						how to freeze food safely. Frozen food should be kept at -18C or
						below.</p>

					<p>HOW TO DO IT:</p>
					<p>You can use the digital display or a dial thermometer to
						check your freezer is keeping food at a safe temperature.</p>

					<h3>Thermometer Types</h3>
					<p>Digital Thermometer
					<h4></h4> These are generally easy to use and accurate. They can be
					used with lots of foods, but they are not suitable to go in the
					oven. Clean and disinfect the probe, then insert the probe. Wait
					for the display to stabilise before taking a reading. Clean the
					probe thoroughly and disinfect it before you use it again. This
					helps to prevent cross-contamination.
					</p>
					<p>Infra-red Thermometer
					<h4></h4> These types of thermometers are used for testing cold
					surface temperatures of food when delivered or in fridges and
					freezers. They cannot be used for checking the temperature in the
					centre of cooked, reheated, or cooling food. Direct the probe at
					the surface of the food avoiding any reflective packaging or sticky
					labels (as this gives a false reading). If the temperature seems
					high, use a clean, disinfected probe thermometer to confirm the
					reading.
					</p>
					<h3>How to Use the Thermometer</h3>
					<p>Checking Your Probe
					<h4></h4> It is essential to know that your probe is working
					properly, so you can rely on its readings. So you should check it
					regularly, for example once a month. The manufacturer’s
					instructions should include details of how often a probe needs to
					be checked and how to tell if it is accurate. A simple way to check
					a digital probe is to put it in iced water and boiling water:
					<ul>
						<li>The readings in iced water should be between -1°C and
							1°C.</li>
						<li>The readings in boiling water should be between 99°C and
							101°C.</li>
					</ul> If the reading is outside this range, you should replace your
					probe or return it to the manufacturer to be calibrated.
					</p>
					<p>Looking After Your Probe
					<h4></h4> It is very important to keep your probe clean, otherwise
					it could spread dirt and harmful bacteria to the food you are
					testing. Before the probe is inserted into food, clean and
					disinfect it, and again after use. Probe wipes are a good way to
					clean and disinfect probe thermometers, however make sure the wipes
					don’t dry out as then they won’t disinfect properly. You need to
					look after your probe to prevent it from getting damaged and help
					keep it working properly. Avoid leaving a digital probe inside a
					fridge, freezer or on hot surfaces for a long period of time. When
					you are not using it, store it safely, away from extreme
					temperatures and liquids. Keep the probe in its case, if it has
					one. Avoid banging or dropping your probe. If the battery is low,
					replace it immediately.
					</p>


					<h1>Managing Food Allergen Information</h1>
					<p>How you handle allergens is important for food safety and to
						keep your customers safe. It is a legal requirement for food
						businesses to provide accurate information about the allergenic
						ingredients used in the food and drink they serve. You also need
						to refer to and complete the ‘Food Allergies’ pages in the Cross
						Contamination section of this pack.</p>
					<p>In 2021, rules will change for food that is pre-packed for
						direct sale (PPDS) - these foods must carry full ingredients
						labelling on the packaging, with the allergens clearly emphasised.
					</p>







					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>Customer information PPDS food must carry full ingredients
						labelling on the packaging, with allergens emphasised clearly. For
						loose foods, such as meals served in a restaurant, you can provide
						allergen information: • in writing e.g. allergen matrix, on a menu
						or chalkboard • Providing the information orally to the customer
						(this must be verified in writing) Staff must know where allergen
						information can be found (e.g. recipe sheets, food labels) and be
						able to handle allergen information requests. If someone asks if a
						dish contains a certain food, this must include all the allergenic
						ingredients in the dish (and what they contain). Allergen
						information must be accurate, consistent and up-to date.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Customers with allergies need to know this information so
						they can make safe food choices to avoid an allergic reaction.
						There should be a way to check that the information provided is
						correct and complete.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Where do you keep allergen information for the foods you
							serve? Do your staff know where to find accurate and up-to-date
							allergen /ingredient information for the foods you serve? Have
							you trained all your staff in how to handle allergen information
							requests? How often do you review staff training in allergen
							management? When do you update your labels? </b>
					</p>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>
					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>For loose foods, such as meals served in restaurants, there
						must be clear signposting letting customers know where to obtain
						allergen information if they need it. For loose foods, such as
						meals served in restaurants, it’s a good idea to give information
						in the name or description of dishes on the menu, especially if
						they include the foods listed over the page, e.g. chocolate and
						almond slice, sesame oil dressing. Remember to update the menu
						when recipes change.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Customers need this information so that they can make safe
						and informed food choices. Customers should let you know if they
						need allergen information so you can help them make safe food
						choices. This helps people with food allergies to spot which
						dishes contain certain ingredients. Remember, you still need to
						have information on all allergenic ingredients available.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Where do you display your signposting so customers know
							where to find allergen information? Do you use detailed
							information in the name or description of dishes on the menu? </b>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>
					<p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
					<p>Take Away – phone / online orders If taking phone orders or
						using a website to advertise and/or take orders, you must be able
						to let your customers know what allergens are in the food you
						serve before the order is placed AND at the point of delivery to
						the customer. You could put a clear and easy to see statement on
						your website, printed menus and flyers to tell customers where
						they can obtain allergen information. You need to make sure your
						staff know how to take orders over the phone and/or online for
						food allergy customers. You must ensure take away orders for
						customers with food allergies can be clearly identified.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This allows customers with food allergies to know what is in
						the food they are ordering so they can choose what is safe for
						them to eat so they don’t have an allergic reaction. If your staff
						do not know how to take orders over the phone/online for food
						allergy customers, this could result in the customer being served
						food which can be harmful to them. If a customer with a food
						allergy cannot easily identify which meal has been prepared for
						them, they could eat the wrong meal and have an allergic reaction.
					</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Are your staff trained in how to take orders over the
							phone/ website for food allergy customers? How do you identify
							meals prepared for a customer with a food allergy at the point of
							delivery? </b>

					<h1>Training and Supervision</h1>
					<p>It is essential to train and supervise your staff
						effectively to make sure they handle food safely. You should train
						your staff in all the safe methods that are relevant to the job
						they do. You should also supervise them to check they are
						following the safe methods properly.</p>
					<h2>What to do</h2>
					<p>Once you have worked through them, use the safe methods in
						this pack to train staff. You need to be sure that each member of
						staff knows the safe methods for all the tasks they do. Show the
						member of staff what to do, question them carefully on their
						knowledge and then ask them to show you. Make sure you know what
						training each member of staff has received and, where necessary,
						provide refresher training regularly. Make a note on the Staff
						training record in the diary every time you train a member of
						staff. Watch the member of staff when they are carrying out a task
						as part of their work. When a member of staff has completed a
						task, ask them about how they followed the safe method, to help
						you find out if they did it correctly. Make comments and
						observations to help the member of staff improve the way they
						work. Reward good performance by giving positive feedback when the
						member of staff has followed the safe method successfully. If the
						safe method is not being followed by the member of staff, tell
						them how they are going wrong and why it is important to follow
						the safe method.</p>
					<p>In addition to the safe methods in this pack, it is a good
						idea to provide your staff with other food safety training.</p>
					<h2>What to do if things go wrong</h2>
					<p>If staff are not following a safe method properly, train
						them again and make sure they understand why it is important to
						follow the method.</p>
					<h2>How to stop this happening again</h2>
					<p>Use the 4-weekly review in the diary to identify any
						problems with how staff are following safe methods and plan your
						training to address these.</p>
					<h2>Manage it</h2>
					<p>When you sign the diary you are confirming that you have
						supervised all the staff involved in making food that day. This
						means making sure that your staff follow your safe methods and
						that any problems are being solved and recorded in the diary. If
						you are away from the business, you can give responsibility for
						the diary to a member of staff. Sometimes there may be more than
						one person responsible during the day, e.g. when there is more
						than one shift, and in these cases the diary may need more than
						one signature. Make a note in the diary of those members of staff
						who have been given this responsibility and train them on all the
						relevant safe methods, including any in the Management section.
						Staff must understand how the diary works. If something different
						happens, or something goes wrong, they will need to take action
						and make a note of what they have done in the diary. You should
						still complete the 4-weekly review yourself.</p>
					<h1>Customers</h1>
					<p>Customer feedback is a good indication of how well you are
						managing your business. Keeping your customers happy and
						protecting their health with good food hygiene is essential to the
						success of the business. It is very important to pay attention to
						any complaints to check whether mistakes have been made and
						prevent it happening again.</p>
					<h2>What to do</h2>
					<p>Listen to complaints. Always take complaints seriously, no
						matter what the circumstances - these could point out a problem in
						your business that needs to be addressed. Complaints could include
						customers who have:
					<ul>
						<li>Symptoms of food poisoning after visiting your premises</li>
						<li>Experienced an allergic reaction during or after visiting
							your premises</li>
						<li>Found something in their food that made it unfit for
							eating</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Find the source of the problem. Try and work out how the
						problem arose. To do this you may need to:
					<ul>
						<li>Review the daily diary for details of any problems</li>
						<li>Check your ‘Prove It’ records, look around your workplace
							and speak with staff to ensure relevant safe methods are being
							followed</li>
						<li>See if any other similar complaints have been received</li>
						<li>Check if any staff have reported illness in the days
							before</li>
					</ul> While you are investigating, it may be appropriate to remove any
					of the same batch of food eaten from sale. It may also be
					appropriate to inform the supplier who provided you with the food
					if the problem may have arisen at their premises.
					</p>
					<p>Solve the problem. Review the relevant safe methods as you
						may need to change how you do things to prevent it happening again
						and retrain staff. Record any changes in the relevant section of
						your pack and make a note in the diary.</p>
					<h1>Suppliers and Contractors</h1>
					<p>How you handle suppliers and contractors is important to
						food safety. You are required by food law to take reasonable
						precautions and do all that is needed to protect your customers.
						If you do not do this, your business and reputation could suffer.
					</p>
					<h2>What to do</h2>
					<h3>Choose suppliers very carefully</h3>
					<p>It is important that you have reputable suppliers that you
						can trust to supply and handle food safely, as well as deliver on
						time etc.
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure you choose reputable suppliers you can trust.</li>
						<li>Ask the following questions:
							<ul>
								<li>Is the supplier registered with the local authority?</li>
								<li>Does the supplier store, transport and pack their goods
									in a hygienic way?</li>
								<li>Does the supplier provide allergen information?</li>
								<li>Do they have any certification or quality assurance?</li>
								<li>Does the supplier/contractor supply fully referenced
									invoices?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Ask other businesses for trusted recommendations.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Make sure that your raw ingredients have been handled
						safely</h3>
					<p>The starting point for making food safely is to be confident
						about the safety of your raw ingredients and any ready-made
						products you buy in.
					<ul>
						<li>Check that the supplier has a food safety management
							system.</li>
						<li>Carry out regular delivery time, temperature and quality
							spot checks.</li>
						<li>If you buy goods from a cash and carry, make sure that
							the vehicle you use to transport them is clean and that you bring
							chilled and frozen food back as soon as possible and put it
							straight into a fridge or freezer.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Keep a record of what food products you have bought, who
						you bought them from, the quantity and the date.</h3>
					<p>This is a legal requirement and is so that you or an
						enforcement officer can check back to see where a food came from.
						Ideally, you should keep these records until you are sure that the
						food they refer to has been consumed without any problems.
					<ul>
						<li>Usually the easiest way to do this is to keep all your
							invoices and receipts. Or you might want to record the
							information in a different way, for example keeping a record of
							the batch number and other details.</li>
						<li>Keep these records in a way that makes it easy for you or
							an enforcement officer to check them.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Choose contractors carefully</h3>
					<p>Services such as pest control can be valuable in helping you
						to make food safely. It is important to have contractors you can
						trust to deliver these services effectively.
					<ul>
						<li>Use the same checks you would use to choose suppliers
							(see top box).</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h2>What to do if things go wrong</h2>
					<p>
						If you are contacted by an unknown food supplier, check with your
						local authority to see if they are a registered and reputable
						business; they could be fraudulent. <br> If you do not think
						that the food a supplier delivers has been handled safely (for
						example, if you think it has not been kept cold enough) reject the
						delivery, contact your supplier immediately and write the details
						in the diary. <br> If you have repeated problems, you can do
						the following things:
					<ol>
						<li>Contact the supplier/contractor by phone.</li>
						<li>Write a formal letter of complaint.</li>
						<li>Change supplier/contractor.</li>
						<li>Contact your local authority.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
					<h1>STOCK CONTROL</h1>
					<p>Effective stock control is an important part of managing
						food safety.</p>
					<h2>WHAT TO DO</h2>
					<h3>WHY?</h3>
					<h3>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Go through your menu and estimate how much of each
							ingredient you will need. Working through the menu allows you to
							plan for your specific needs.</li>
						<li>Review your menu regularly and how it affects your needs
							for stock.</li>
						<li>Discuss your needs with your supplier.</li>
						<li>Plan ahead to make sure you have the right amount of
							stock and order carefully. Not having too much stock is best for
							food safety – and your profits.</li>
						<li>Plan the stock you need for each shift.</li>
						<li>Make sure staff know the stock requirements for each
							shift.</li>
						<li>Use a supplier who understands your business needs and
							supplies stock on time.</li>
						<li>Do a stock check before placing an order.</li>
						<li>Check all stock when it is delivered to make sure that:
							<ul>
								<li>it is within its ‘use by’ date</li>
								<li>it has been kept cold enough</li>
								<li>it has not gone off</li>
								<li>the stock is clean and not damaged, e.g. throw away any
									punctured vacuum packs, swollen packs or badly dented cans and
									check that tops are secure on bottles and jars and seals are
									unbroken.</li>
							</ul> These checks are all to make sure that food is safe for you to
							use. Damaged packaging could mean that food will not be safe to
							use. Swollen or ‘blown’ packs can be a sign that bacteria have
							grown in food or drinks. If bottles or jars have been opened, or
							if seals have been broken, the food or drink might not be safe to
							use.
						</li>
						<li>Train your staff in what to look for when checking
							deliveries.</li>
						<li>Have a written agreement with your supplier about your
							delivery requirements.</li>
						<li>Carry out spot checks on the deliveries yourself.</li>
						<li>Use the diary to record any issues or problems with
							deliveries.</li>
						<li>If you move food from its original packaging to another
							container, make sure you make a note of the name of the food, the
							ingredients and the ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date.</li>
						<li>Carry out regular stock checks and throw away any food
							that has passed its ‘use by’ date.</li>
						<li>If you freeze food, have a system in place to make sure
							it is clearly labelled with the date it is frozen. It is against
							the law to serve food after its ‘use by’ date because it might
							not be safe to eat and could make your customers ill. If
							labelling is not clear on frozen food, new stock might be used
							before old stock.</li>
						<li>Follow the ‘first in, first out’ system of stock
							rotation, so that older stock is used first. This helps to avoid
							waste.</li>
						<li>Train your staff in stock control and make sure they know
							in what order to use foods.</li>
						<li>Check regularly that stock control is being carried out
							effectively and food past its ‘use by’ date is thrown away.</li>

						<li>Record stock checks in the diary.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>If you find that you have more food in stock than you
							need and you do not think you will use it all before the ‘use by’
							date, you could freeze some of it to be used in the future.
							Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on freezing and label the
							food as appropriate. See ‘Freezing safe method’</li>
						<li>If you find that food that has passed its ‘use by’ date
							has not been thrown away, throw it away immediately.</li>
						<li>If you do not think that a food delivery has been handled
							safely, reject the delivery if possible. Do not use the food and
							contact your supplier immediately.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Review your ordering process.</li>
						<li>Review your stock rotation system.</li>
						<li>Review your agreement with your supplier.</li>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1>PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL AND RECALL</h1>
					<p>Responding quickly to any problems with food products you
						use or sell is an important part of managing food safety in your
						business. Sometimes there will be a problem with a food product
						that means you will need to ‘withdraw’ it (when you should stop
						using/selling it) and/or ‘recall’ it (when customers are asked to
						return/destroy a product).</p>
					<h2>You may find out about a problem with a product from:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>a manufacturer of the product</li>
						<li>a supplier or wholesaler</li>
						<li>a notice in newspapers</li>
						<li>your local authority</li>
						<li>a trade association</li>
						<li>the Food Standards Agency</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you hear about a problem with a product, you should stop
						using/selling it straight away. You might also need to tell your
						customers. There are a number of reasons that a product might be
						withdrawn or recalled. For example, it could have been found to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>contain harmful bacteria</li>
						<li>be physically contaminated, e.g. with pieces of glass or
							metal</li>
						<li>be wrongly labelled, which could be a problem for people
							with food allergies</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You or your staff may also notice a problem with a food
						product that means it may not be safe to eat. If this happens, you
						should stop using/selling it straight away and tell your local
						authority and the Food Standards Agency.</p>
					<h2>WHAT TO DO</h2>
					<h3>HOW?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure you know the details of the problem. If a
							manufacturer or supplier has issued a product withdrawal or
							recall, make sure you know which product and which batches are
							affected.</li>
						<li>As soon as you find out about a problem with a product,
							stop using/selling it. Remove the affected product from anywhere
							you use, store or sell it and label it clearly to show it should
							not be used/sold.</li>
						<li>Remember to check if you have used the product as an
							ingredient in any food you have prepared and stored, e.g. in the
							freezer – if you have, ask your local authority for advice.</li>
						<li>Make sure your staff know about the problem. This is so
							your staff know what to do and do not use/sell the product.</li>
						<li>Tell your customers if you need to. If the problem is
							with a product that your customers might not eat or drink
							straight away, you may need to let them know that the product is
							being recalled and why.</li>
						<li>If the manufacturer or supplier asks you to put up a
							recall notice, you should do this. If you are not sure what to
							do, contact your local authority.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>THINK TWICE!</h2>
					<p>It is a legal requirement to keep a record of what food
						products you have bought, who you bought them from, the quantity
						and the date. Usually the easiest way to do this is to keep all
						your invoices and receipts. You should keep this information in a
						way that makes it easy for you or an enforcement officer to check
						back to see where a product came from.</p>
					<h1>SAFE METHOD COMPLETION RECORD</h1>
					<p>To complete the pack you need to work through each section
						and complete all the safe methods that are relevant to your
						business. Most small caterers will need to fill in all the
						methods. But if, for example, a business does not hot hold food
						then the ‘Hot holding’ method will not be relevant to them.</p>
					<p>It does not matter in what order you work through the safe
						methods. As you complete each one, fill in this record. When you
						have completed all the safe methods that are relevant to your
						business, this sheet will show that you have worked through the
						pack.</p>
					<p>This record can be in the form of a checklist or a table
						where you can mark off each safe method as you complete it. It
						should include a space for you to provide any additional notes or
						observations related to the implementation of the safe method in
						your business.</p>
					<p>It's important to keep this completion record up to date and
						to review it regularly to ensure that all the relevant safe
						methods are being followed and that there are no gaps in your food
						safety management system.</p>
					<p>Having a record of completion for the safe methods can also
						serve as proof that you are taking the necessary steps to ensure
						food safety in your business and can be helpful in case of any
						inspections or audits.</p>
