					<h1>HOW TO USE THIS PACK</h1>
					<p>Welcome to Safer Food Better Business for caterers</p>

					<h2>IS THIS PACK FOR ME?</h2>
					<p>This pack is for small catering businesses such as
						restaurants, cafés and takeaways that have registered with the
						local authority as a food business. It has been developed by the
						Food Standards Agency, working with catering businesses, to be
						practical and easy to use.</p>

					<h2>REGISTRATION</h2>
					<p>If you haven't already, you must register your food business
						with the Environmental Health Team at your local council. This
						should be done at least 28 days before you start food operations.
						If you have bought an existing food business from someone else,
						you need to register as the new owner. You must also tell your
						local authority about any significant changes to your business.</p>

					<p>
						For more information, visit <a
							href="https://food.gov.uk/guidance/registering-a-new-or-existing-food-business">Guidance
							on how to register a new and existing food business</a>.
					</p>

					<h2>HOW DOES THIS PACK HELP ME COMPLY WITH THE LAW?</h2>
					<p>Food safety and hygiene regulations say that you must be
						able to show what you do to make and sell food that is safe to eat
						and have this written down. The pack helps you do this.</p>

					<p>This pack is based on the principles of HACCP (hazard
						analysis and critical control point), but you will not find words
						such as "HACCP"" or "hazard" in the pack because we have cut out
						all the jargon.</p>

					<h2>HOW DOES THE PACK WORK?</h2>
					<p>The pack contains sheets for you to work through and
						complete. These are called 'safe methods'.</p>

					<p>It also contains a diary for you to fill in every day and
						write down anything different that happens, including anything
						that goes wrong.</p>

					<h2>WHO SHOULD TAKE CHARGE OF THE PACK?</h2>
					<p>The operator of the business has overall responsibility for
						ensuring the food served to customers is safe to eat.</p>

					<p>All food handlers are responsible for following the safe
						methods within this pack and reporting any problems to the food
						business operator immediately.</p>

					<p>The person who takes charge of the pack needs to make sure
						other staff know how to use the pack and the diary is completed
						when they are not at work.</p>

					<p>They also need to make sure the pack is reviewed regularly
						and updated where needed.</p>

					<h1>HOW TO USE THE SAFE METHODS</h1>

					<h2>Front</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The 'Safety point' column highlights things that are
							important to make food safely.</li>
						<li>The 'Why' column tells you why the safety point is
							important.</li>
						<li>The 'How do you do this?' column is for you to write down
							what you do.</li>
						<li>In some places you only need to tick a box and in other
							places write a small amount.</li>
						<li>Pictures help to illustrate the safety points.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Back</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Some safe methods have a 'Check it' section, which tells
							you what to look for to make sure your method has worked.</li>
						<li>The 'What to do if things go wrong' column gives
							practical tips on how to tackle problems.</li>
						<li>The 'How to stop this happening again' column tells you
							how you can prevent problems.</li>
						<li>If things go wrong, write down what happened and what you
							did in your diary. Each safe method reminds you to do this.</li>
						<li>Sometimes the pictures are marked with one of these
							symbols: RIGHT WRONG</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>HOW TO USE THE DIARY</h2>
					<p>The diary should be filled in every day by the person
						responsible for running the business. There is also a 4-weekly
						review so you can look back at previous weeks and identify any
						persistent problems.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Fill in the date at the start of the week.</li>
						<li>Each day, tick here to say you have completed your
							Opening checks and your Closing checks – see the Management
							section for more information on these.</li>
						<li>If anything different happens or something goes wrong,
							make a note of it under the appropriate day.</li>
						<li>Each day, write your name and sign to say that all the
							safe methods have been followed.</li>
						<li>If you do any Extra checks, (e.g. something you don't do
							every day such as maintenance of equipment or cleaning the
							freezer) make a note in the section at the end of the week – see
							the Management section for more information on these.</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>QUESTIONS</h1>

					<h2>WHAT DO I DO NEXT?</h2>
					<p>Work through the pack one section at a time and complete all
						the safe methods that are relevant to your business. It will take
						you about one hour to complete a section. We suggest you do one
						section at a time, for example one a week so that it is just one
						hour of your time to get started.</p>
					<p>When you have worked through all the sections, make sure you
						and your staff:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>follow the safe methods all the time</li>
						<li>fill in the diary every day</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>HOW DO I USE THE 'WORKING WITH FOOD?' FACTSHEET</h2>
					<p>Use the 'Working with food?' factsheet to train your staff
						on good personal hygiene on their first day at work. It has been
						designed to help overcome language difficulties. Food Safety
						Coaching videos are available on the FSA YouTube channel.</p>

					<h2>HOW WILL I BENEFIT FROM USING THIS PACK?</h2>
					<p>Using the pack in your business will help you to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>comply with food hygiene regulations</li>
						<li>show what you do to make food safely</li>
						<li>train staff</li>
						<li>protect your business's reputation</li>
						<li>improve your business, e.g. by wasting less food</li>
						<li>improve your Food Hygiene Rating</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>DO I NEED TO KEEP LOTS OF DAILY RECORDS?</h2>
					<p>No, you do not need lots of daily records. Once you have
						worked through the pack and completed all the relevant safe
						methods, you only need to fill in the diary each day.</p>
					<p>It is a legal requirement to keep a record of what food
						products you have bought, who you bought them from, the quantity,
						the date and allergen information. Usually the easiest way to do
						this is to keep all your invoices and receipts.</p>

					<h2>DO I NEED TO USE A TEMPERATURE PROBE?</h2>
					<p>You can use this pack in your business without using a
						temperature probe. However, use of a probe is the best way to
						provide reassurance that what you are doing is safe when cooking,
						reheating, hot holding or chilling. See the 'Prove it' safe method
						in the Management section.</p>

					<h2>WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION?</h2>
					<p>For more information on food safety, visit the FSA website.</p>
					<p>If unsure about any of the guidance in this pack, you can
						contact the Environmental Health Team at your local council.</p>

					<h2>FOOD HYGIENE RATINGS</h2>
					<h3>INTRODUCTION TO FOOD HYGIENE RATINGS</h3>
					<p>Following a food safety inspection from your local council,
						your business will receive a Food Hygiene Rating as part of the
						national Food Hygiene Rating Scheme.</p>
					<p>Food Hygiene Ratings help customers choose where to eat or
						buy food - high ratings are good for business.</p>
					<p>Ratings are a snapshot of the standards of food hygiene &
						safety found at the time of inspection, however it is the
						responsibility of the business to comply with food law at all
						times.</p>
					<p>Your Food Hygiene Rating is based on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Hygienic handling of food including preparation, cooking,
							re-heating, cooling and storage</li>
						<li>Cleanliness and condition of the building and how it is
							maintained</li>
						<li>Management of food safety, including documentation and
							records</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>GETTING A HIGHER FOOD HYGIENE RATING</h3>
					<p>If you receive a lower rating, your local council will
						provide you with information on how to improve and will re-inspect
						your business at a later date. Here are some tips on how to
						improve your rating:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure all staff are properly trained in food hygiene
							and safety</li>
						<li>Keep your premises clean and well-maintained</li>
						<li>Implement food safety management procedures, such as
							HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)</li>
						<li>Make sure all equipment is in good working order and is
							cleaned regularly</li>
						<li>Keep accurate food safety records</li>
						<li>Regularly review and update your food safety procedures
							to ensure they are up-to-date</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>DISPLAYING YOUR FOOD HYGIENE RATING</h3>
					<p>By law, all food businesses in England, Wales and Northern
						Ireland are required to display their food hygiene rating at their
						premises, or provide it upon request. This can be done in the form
						of a sticker or certificate provided by your local council, or by
						displaying the rating online through the FSA website. This is to
						help customers make informed choices about where to eat or buy
						food.</p>
					<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
					<p>Maintaining high standards of food hygiene and safety is
						essential for any catering business. By using the Safer Food
						Better Business pack and following the guidelines provided, you
						can ensure that your business is compliant with food safety
						regulations and can improve your Food Hygiene Rating. This will
						not only protect your customers but also benefit your business in
						terms of reputation and customer loyalty. Remember, if you ever
						have any doubts or questions, you can always seek guidance from
						the Environmental Health Team at your local council.</p>

					<h3>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU START</h3>
					<p>It is easy for you to spread bacteria and viruses to food
						without realizing. These bacteria are invisible and could make
						customers ill. Your personal hygiene is important. This is what
						you need to do to keep food safe:</p>
					<h4>BEFORE YOU START WORKING WITH FOOD</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Always wash your hands</li>
						<li>Wear clean clothes</li>
						<li>Wear an apron if handling unwrapped food</li>
						<li>Tell your manager if you have vomiting or diarrhea and do
							not work with food</li>
						<li>Take off your watch and jewelry</li>
						<li>It is a good idea to tie hair back and wear a hat or
							hairnet</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH FOOD</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>No smoking</li>
						<li>No eating or drinking</li>
						<li>Avoid touching your face, coughing or sneezing over food</li>
						<li>Cover cuts with a brightly colored waterproof dressing</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>WASHING HANDS EFFECTIVELY</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Wet your hands thoroughly under warm running water and
							squirt liquid soap onto your palm</li>
						<li>Rub your hands together palm to palm to make a lather</li>
						<li>Rub the palm of one hand along the back of the other and
							along the fingers. Repeat with the other hand</li>
						<li>Put your palms together with fingers interlocked and rub
							in between each of the fingers thoroughly</li>
						<li>Rub around your thumbs on each hand and then rub the
							fingertips of each hand against your palms</li>

						<li>Rinse off the soap with clean running water and dry your
							hands thoroughly on a disposable towel. Turn off the tap with the
							towel and then throw the towel away</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>WHEN TO WASH HANDS</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Before touching or handling any food, especially
							ready-to-eat food</li>
						<li>After going to the toilet</li>
						<li>After every break</li>
						<li>After touching raw meat, poultry, fish, eggs or unwashed
							vegetables</li>
						<li>After touching a cut or changing a dressing</li>
						<li>After touching or emptying bins</li>
						<li>After any cleaning</li>
						<li>After touching phones, light switches, door handles, cash
							registers and money</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>CROSS-CONTAMINATION</h3>
					<p>Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food
						poisoning. It happens when harmful bacteria, viruses or allergens
						are spread onto food from other food, surfaces, hands or
						equipment. Food Standards Agency l food.gov.uk/sfbb</p>
					<p>Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food
						poisoning. It happens when harmful bacteria or viruses are spread
						onto food from other food, surfaces, hands or equipment. These
						harmful bacteria often come from raw meat/poultry, fish, eggs and
						unwashed vegetables. It is particularly important to ensure that
						ready-to-eat foods are not contaminated in this way.</p>
					<p>Other sources of bacteria can include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>staff</li>
						<li>pests</li>
						<li>equipment</li>
						<li>cloths</li>
						<li>dirt or soil</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When you handle raw and ready-to-eat food in your business
						you may need to consider extra procedures to help keep the food
						you produce safe. More information can be found on the FSA website
						Do not forget that you should also protect food from 'physical
						contamination' (where objects get into food, e.g. broken glass or
						pieces of packaging) and 'chemical contamination' (where chemicals
						get into food, e.g. cleaning products or pest control chemicals).</p>
					<p>This section also includes information on food allergies.
						Good cleaning and handling practices can help manage the risk of
						cross-contamination from allergens. Food Standards Agency l
						food.gov.uk/sfbb</p>
					<h4>SAFE METHOD:</h4>
					<h5>PERSONAL HYGIENE AND FITNESS TO WORK</h5>
					<p>It is vital for staff to follow good personal hygiene
						practices to help prevent bacteria and viruses from spreading to
						food.</p>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Staff should always wash their hands thoroughly before
						handling and preparing food. (See the 'Handwashing' method in the
						Cleaning section.)</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Handwashing is one of the best ways to prevent harmful
						bacteria and viruses from spreading.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Are all staff trained to wash their hands before preparing
							food? </b>
					</p>
				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test2}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"
					th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('test3')}" th:errors="*{test3}"></div>
				<label>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>All staff should wear clean clothes when working with food.
						Ideally, they should change into clean work clothes before
						starting work and not wear these clothes outside food preparation
						areas. Work clothes should be appropriate for staff duties and
						protect food from contamination. Ideally, they should be light -
						coloured with no external pockets. It is also a good idea to wear
						a clean apron or disposable apron over work clothes.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Clothes can bring dirt and bacteria into food preparation
						areas. Wearing clean clothes helps to prevent this. Work clothes
						should minimise skin coming into contact with food and prevent
						hairs, fibres and the contents of pockets (which can carry
						bacteria) getting into food. Light colours show dirt clearly.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do your staff wear clean work clothes? Do your staff change
							clothes before starting work? Describe your staff's work clothes.</b>
					</p>
				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test3}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"
					th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('test4')}" th:errors="*{test4}"></div>
				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Staff should change aprons after working with raw food e.g.
						meat, poultry, eggs or unwashed vegetables.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>CAprons help to stop dirt and bacteria from getting onto
						work clothes and they can be removed easily for washing, or thrown
						away if disposable.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>What type of aprons do you use? Which tasks do you use them
							for?</b>
					</p>
				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test4}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"
					th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('test5')}" th:errors="*{test5}"></div>
				<label>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>It is good practice for staff to keep hair tied back and
						wear a hat when preparing food. Staff should not wear watches or
						jewellery when preparing food (except a plain wedding band). Staff
						should not smoke, drink, eat or chew gum while handling food.
						Staff should also avoid touching their face or nose, or coughing
						and sneezing over or near food, and wash hands if they do.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>If hair is not tied back or covered, it is more likely to
						fall into food and staff are more likely to touch their hair.
						Watches and jewellery can collect and spread dirt and harmful
						bacteria, and fall into the food. All of these lead to staff
						touching their face or mouth. Harmful bacteria can be spread from
						someone's face or mouth to their hands and then onto food.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Are staff trained to follow these things? </b>
					</p>

				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test5}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"
					th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('test6')}" th:errors="*{test6}"></div>
				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Staff should be 'fit for work' at all times. This means that
						they must not be suffering from, or carrying, an illness or
						disease that could cause a problem with food safety. Any member of
						staff who has diarrhoea and/or vomiting should report it to their
						manager immediately and either stay at home or go home straight
						away. Staff who have had diarrhoea and/ or vomiting should not
						return to work until they have had no symptoms for 48 hours. Staff
						should tell their manager if they have any cuts or sores and these
						should be completely covered with a brightly coloured waterproof
						dressing.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>People who are not 'fit for work' could spread harmful
						bacteria or viruses to food. See the FSA website for more
						information. People suffering from these symptoms often carry
						harmful bacteria on their hands and can spread them to food or
						equipment they touch. Even if the diarrhoea and vomiting has
						stopped, someone can still carry harmful bacteria for 48 hours
						afterwards. Cuts and sores can carry harmful bacteria. Covering
						them prevents bacteria spreading to food. Coloured waterproof
						dressings can be seen more easily if they drop into food.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do your food handlers understand the importance of being
							'fit for work' and what they need to report? Do you check food
							handlers have been free of symptoms for 48 hours before returning
							to work?</b>
					</p>
				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test6}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"
					th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('test7')}" th:errors="*{test7}"></div>
				<label>
					<div>
						<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>If staff are not 'fit for work', move them out of food
								handling areas or send them home. Throw away any unwrapped foods
								they have handled.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
							<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>


					<p>MANAGE IT:</p>
					<p>Make sure that all staff understand the importance of being
						'fit for work' and what they need to report. It is a good idea to
						have a separate area where staff can change and store their
						outdoor clothes. It is good practice to keep a clean set of work
						clothes or disposable aprons for visitors.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This is so they understand how some types of illness can
						affect the safety of food and that they must tell their manager if
						they have these types of illness. Clothes could be a source of
						bacteria if they are left lying around. Anyone entering the
						kitchen can bring in bacteria on their clothes.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Where do staff change and store their outdoor clothes?
							Where do you keep clean uniforms/ disposable aprons?</b>
					</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"
					th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('test8')}" th:errors="*{test8}"></div>
				<label>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Use disposable cloths wherever possible, and throw them away
						after each task. Always use a new or freshly cleaned and
						disinfected cloth to wipe work surfaces, equipment or utensils
						that will be used with ready-to-eat food. Cloths can't be used for
						both floors and other surfaces. Take away re-usable cloths for
						thorough washing and disinfection after using them with raw
						meat/poultry, eggs or raw vegetables – and surfaces that have
						touched these foods. If using re-usable cloths, make sure they are
						thoroughly washed, disinfected and dried properly between tasks
						(not just when they look dirty). Ideally, wash cloths in a washing
						machine on a very hot cycle. A suitably high temperature can be
						obtained using a hot cycle of 90C. If you wash and disinfect
						cloths by hand, make sure all the food and dirt has been removed
						by washing in hot soapy water before you disinfect them. After
						washing, you can disinfect by using boiling water or a suitable
						disinfectant, following the manufacturer's instructions (please
						note bleach is not a suitable disinfectant).</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This will make sure that any bacteria and allergens picked
						up by the cloth will not be spread. It is especially important to
						protect ready-to-eat food from bacteria. This is because the food
						will not be cooked, so any bacteria on the food will not be
						killed. Raw meat/poultry and eggs are more likely to contain
						harmful bacteria than other foods. The soil on vegetables can also
						contain harmful bacteria. Using dirty cloths can spread bacteria
						and allergens very easily. Cloths that are not dried properly can
						increase the risk of bacteria. A hot wash cycle will clean the
						cloths thoroughly and kill bacteria (disinfect). If food or dirt
						is still on the cloths, this will prevent the disinfection process
						from being effective, so harmful bacteria might not be killed.</p>

					<p>JOBS:</p>
					<p>Holding hot items (e.g. oven trays) - use tea towel or

						<h1>SEPARATING FOODS</h1>
						<p>Keeping raw and ready-to-eat food separate is essential to
							prevent harmful bacteria from spreading. Raw foods include raw
							meats & unwashed salad, vegetables and fruits. Ready-to-eat foods
							include cooked foods, washed salads, garnishes, desserts and
							other foods that will not be cooked before eating.</p>
						<p>
							For more information on separating foods visit the <a
								href='https://www.food.gov.uk/'>FSA website</a>
						</p>
					</div>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Delivery and collection: Plan delivery times so that, if
						possible, raw foods arrive at different times to other foods. If
						delivered together, raw and readyto-eat foods must be kept
						separate.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This helps to prevent harmful bacteria spreading from raw
						foods to ready-to-eat foods.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Storage: Ideally, store raw and ready-to-eat food in
						separate fridges, freezers and display units. If they are in the
						same unit, store raw meat, poultry, fish and eggs below
						ready-to-eat food. Unwashed fruit and vegetables should also be
						kept separate from ready-to-eat food and above raw meat. Use
						either separate containers for raw & ready-to-eat foods or clean
						and heat disinfect between uses. Cover cooked foods and other raw
						and ready-to-eat food using lids, foil or cling film. Coverings
						for raw and ready to eat foods should be kept separate.</p>

						food to ready-to-eat food.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Defrosting: Keep raw foods that are defrosting in the fridge
						in a covered container, below ready-to-eat food, or in a separate
						area of the kitchen away from other foods. (See the 'Defrosting'
						method in the Chilling section.)</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>When raw foods are defrosting, the liquid that comes out can

				<label>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Preparation: Prepare raw foods in different areas. If this
						is not possible, separate by preparing them at different times to
						ready-to-eat foods and thoroughly clean and disinfect between
						tasks using the '2 stage clean'. Where possible, ready-to-eat food
						preparation should take place before raw food preparation.
						Dedicated colour coded chopping boards and utensils should be
						used. Do not wash raw meat or poultry.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Harmful bacteria from raw meat/ poultry can spread from
						chopping boards and knives to other foods. Washing meat does not
						kill bacteria and allergens, but it can splash harmful bacteria
						around the kitchen contaminating sinks, taps and surfaces and
						ready-to-eat food.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Which of the following controls do you have in place?
							Different areas for raw and ready-to-eat food preparation, same

					<h2>THINK TWICE!</h2> Equipment with moving parts: <br> You
					should not use the same equipment, such as vacuum packing machines,
					slicers and mincers, for both raw and ready-to-eat food. These are
					complex pieces of machinery with lots of moving parts and it is
					very difficult to clean them sufficiently, so bacteria from raw
					food could easily be transferred to ready-to-eat food. <br> To
					clean this equipment effectively, it needs to be taken apart.
					(Vacuum packing machines require a specialist to do this.) <br>
					If you are unsure of what to do, check with the Environmental
					Health Team at your local council.
					</p>



					<h2>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>If you think that ready-to-eat food has not been kept
							separate from raw food, throw away the food.</li>
						<li>If equipment/surfaces/utensils have been touched by raw
							food, wash, disinfect and dry them to prevent harmful bacteria
							from spreading.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>

						<li>Make sure you have enough storage space and it is well
							organized.</li>
					</ul>


					<h1>FOOD ALLERGIES</h1>
					<p>It is important to know what to do if you serve a customer
						who has a food allergy, because these allergies can be
						life-threatening. By law, you must tell your customers if certain
						food allergens are in the food you prepare (see the section on the
						next page). You also need to refer to and complete the 'Managing
						Food Allergen information' pages in the Management section of this
						pack. All of the FSA's information, guidance and templates are
						available on the FSA website.</p>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Delivery and Collection: Make sure, at the point of
						delivery, you label the food and check you have all the ingredient
						information you need from the supplier.</p>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Preparation: Make sure you do not contaminate foods for an
						allergic consumer while you are preparing food for them. Check the
						labelling information to make sure that any ingredients used to
						prepare the dish do not contain the food they are allergic to,
						including oils, dressings, glazes, sauces and garnishes. If the
						labels of any of the ingredients you are using to prepare that
						dish say they may contain certain food allergens or are not
						suitable for certain food allergy sufferers, you need to let the
						customer know and ask them if they still wish to order. When you
						have been asked to prepare a dish that does not contain a certain
						food, make sure work surfaces and equipment have been thoroughly
						cleaned first. Make sure staff wash their hands thoroughly before
						preparing the dish. You should also have separate preparation
						boards and equipment dedicated to allergy-free meals. If you make
						a mistake when preparing a dish for a customer with a food
						allergy, do not just remove the ingredient containing the allergen
						from the dish and still serve the food - start from scratch with
						fresh ingredients. Remember: unlike bacteria, allergens are always
						present in the food and cannot be removed or destroyed by cooking.
					</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This helps to prevent small amounts of the food that a
						person is allergic to getting into the dish accidentally, which
						could prove fatal.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Storage: It is important to make sure all foods are labelled
						clearly listing the allergens in the food, fully covered, resealed
						or placed into sealed containers if needed and any food spillages
						in storage areas/equipment are cleaned up quickly. Make sure you
						clearly label containers with the ingredients.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Allergens can easily be transferred from one food to another
						meaning allergen-free foods can become contaminated and no longer
						allergenfree. This poses a risk to a customer with a food allergy
						being served food and suffering an allergic reaction.</p>

					<div style="font-size: larger;">PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL
						CONTAMINATION</div>
					<p>It is very important to prevent objects and chemicals
						getting into food.</p>
					<div style="font-size: larger;">SAFETY POINT</div>
					<p>Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to use and
						store cleaning chemicals. Store cleaning chemicals separately from
						food and make sure they are clearly labelled. This is to prevent
						these chemicals getting into food.</p>
					<p>Keep food covered. This helps to stop things falling into
						the food.</p>
					<p>Make sure you control pests effectively. (See the 'Pest
						control' safe method.) This is to stop insects, droppings etc.
						getting into food, as well as preventing the spread of bacteria.</p>
					<p>Make sure that any chemicals you use to control pests are
						used and stored in the correct way and clearly labelled. This is
						to prevent these chemicals getting into food.</p>
					<p>Always clear and clean as you go and take care to throw away
						packaging, string etc. as soon as you remove it. (See the Clear
						and clean as you go' safe method in the Cleaning section.) Keeping
						surfaces clear and clean will help prevent chemicals and objects
						getting into food, as well as preventing the spread of bacteria.</p>
					<p>Repair or replace any equipment or utensils that are damaged
						or have loose parts. Loose parts may get into food by accident.</p>
					<p>It is a good idea to have a rule of no glass in the kitchen.
						This helps to prevent broken glass getting into food.</p>

					<div style="font-size: larger;">WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</div>
					<ul>
						<li>If chemicals or objects, such as glass, insects or
							coloured waterproof dressings get into food, throw the food away.</li>
						<li>If you find pests or signs of pests, take action
							immediately. (See the 'Pest control' safe method.)</li>
						<li>If you find objects in food that has been delivered,
							reject the delivery, if possible, and contact your supplier
							immediately.</li>
					</ul>
					<div style="font-size: larger;">HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING
						AGAIN</div>
					<ul>
						<li>Review how you use and store chemicals in your business.</li>
						<li>Review your pest control arrangements.</li>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
						<li>Write down what went wrong and what you did about it in
							your diary.</li>
					</ul>
					<div style="font-size: larger;">THINK TWICE!</div>
					<p>When you clean work surfaces, make sure that any cleaning
						chemicals you use are suitable for surfaces touched by food. Check
						the manufacturer's instructions on how they should be used.</p>
					<div style="font-size: larger;">THINK TWICE!</div>
					<p>Covering foods It is important to keep food covered to help
						protect it from harmful bacteria. This is especially important for
						cooked food and other ready-to-eat food. Always use containers or
						bags that have been designed to store food. Suggested food
						coverings include kitchen foil, cling film, plastic boxes with
						lids or freezer bags. Keep unused food coverings clean and
						separate from food.</p>
					<p>When you are covering food:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check the manufacturer's instructions to see if the
							covering is suitable for what you are using it for.</li>
						<li>Always make sure that the food is properly covered.</li>
						<li>Take care not to let the covering fall into foods.</li>
						<li>Never re-use foil, cling film or freezer bags and do not
							store food in opened tins.</li>
						<li>Make sure that plastic boxes are washed, disinfected and
							dried between uses.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Avoid re-using food packaging to store food. Often packaging
						is designed to be used once with a certain food, so it might not
						be safe to use it again, or to use it with a different food. If
						food packaging is used in a way that it was not designed for,
						chemicals could transfer into the food. Instead, use re-usable
						containers that have been designed to store food.</p>

					<h1>Pest Control</h1>
					<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If you see signs of a pest infestation, call a pest
							contractor immediately. Write the contact details for your pest
							contractor on the Contacts list in the diary.</li>
						<li>If you think any equipment, surfaces or utensils have

						<li>If you think food has been touched by pests in any way,
							throw it away.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make your pest checks more frequent.</li>
						<li>Maintain high standards of cleanliness and housekeeping
							to discourage activity.</li>
						<li>Improve staff training on recognizing signs of pests and
							encourage them to report problems immediately.</li>
						<li>If you have persistent problems with pests, consider

					</ul>
					<h3>THINK TWICE!</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Never let pest control bait/chemicals, including sprays,
							come into contact with food, packaging, equipment or surfaces,
							because they are likely to be poisonous to people.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>MANAGE IT</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure no food or dirty plates etc. are left out at
							night – these are a source of food for pests.</li>
						<li>Make sure that checks for pests are carried out

						<li>Put reminders of when to check for pests in your diary.</li>
						<li>If you have a pest contractor, keep a record of their
							contact details and visits in your diary, as well as any feedback
							or action points they recommend. Make a note of when you have
							carried these out.</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>MAINTENANCE</h1>
					<p>Effective maintenance is essential to allow you to clean
						properly and keep pests out.</p>
					<h3>SAFETY POINT</h3>
					<p>All surfaces in the kitchen should be smooth and easy to
						clean. Repair structural damage as soon as it happens, e.g.
						damp/chipped plaster, broken tiles, holes in walls or windows.
						Structural damage can make your premises harder to clean. It can
						attract pests, dirt and allows harmful bacteria to collect there.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check extractor fans and filters regularly to make sure
							they are working properly and are free from grease and dirt. This
							is to make sure the fans and filters can do their job properly.</li>
						<li>Replace chopping boards that are scratched, pitted or
							scored. Dirt and harmful bacteria can collect in any areas where
							the board is not smooth.</li>
						<li>Repair or replace any equipment or utensils that are
							damaged or have loose parts. Dirt and harmful bacteria can
							collect in damaged equipment/utensils. Loose parts may fall into
							food.</li>
						<li>Throw away any cracked or chipped dishes and other
							tableware. Dirt and harmful bacteria can collect in cracks or
							chips.</li>
						<li>Make sure your cooking, hot holding and chilling
							equipment is well maintained and working properly. If it does not
							work properly, food may not be kept safe.</li>
						<li>Temperature probes should be checked regularly to make
							sure their readings are accurate. If your probe is not accurate,
							then it will not give a reliable measure of whether food is at a
							safe temperature. (See the 'Prove it' safe method in the
							Management section.)</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If you think that equipment might not be working
							properly, check it straight away. Do not wait until it has broken
							down. Check that staff are using the equipment properly.</li>
						<li>Look at the manufacturer's instructions to see if there
							is a troubleshooting section.</li>
						<li>Contact the equipment manufacturer or your maintenance
							contractor, if you have one.</li>
						<li>Use alternative equipment until the fault has been
							corrected.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make your maintenance checks more frequent.</li>
						<li>Encourage staff to report any structural damage or
							problems with equipment, so you know about problems early.</li>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
						<li>Write down what went wrong and what you did about it in
							your diary.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>MANAGE IT:</p>
					<p>
					<li>Check your premises regularly for any structural damage or
						problems with equipment.</li>
					<li>Put problems right as soon as possible, before they get
						worse or affect food safety. Make a note in your diary of what you
						do.</li>
					<li>Put reminders in your diary of maintenance checks and make
						a note of any repairs you make.</li>

					<h1>CLEANING</h1>
					<h3>Effective cleaning is essential to get rid of harmful
						bacteria, viruses and allergens to stop them spreading to food.</h3>
					<p>This section tells you about handwashing, cleaning
						effectively, how to 'clear and clean as you go' and developing a
						cleaning schedule.</p>


					<h2>HANDWASHING</h2>
					<p>Effective handwashing is essential to help prevent bacteria
						spreading to food.</p>
					<p>Make sure all staff who work with food wash their hands
						properly before handling or preparing food, including after
						handling raw food and before handling ready-to-eat food. Remember:
						effective hand washing takes time.</p>
					<p>For a video demonstration, visit the FSA YouTube channel</p>
					<h4>WASHING HANDS EFFECTIVELY</h4>
					<p>Step 1: Wet your hands thoroughly under warm running water
						and squirt liquid soap onto your palm.</p>
					<p>Step 2: Rub your hands together palm to palm to make a
						lather.</p>
					<p>Step 3: Rub the palm of one hand along the back of the other
						and along the fingers. Repeat with the other hand.</p>
					<p>Step 4: Put your palms together with fingers interlocked and
						rub in between each of the fingers thoroughly.</p>
					<p>Step 5: Rub around your thumbs on each hand and then rub the
						fingertips of each hand against your palms.</p>
					<p>Step 6: Rinse off the soap with clean running water and dry
						your hands thoroughly on a disposable towel. Turn off the tap with
						the towel and then throw the towel away.</p>




					<p>CHECK IT:</p>
					<p>For hands to be washed properly, you need warm running
						water, liquid soap and preferably disposable towels. Ideally,
						antibacterial soap should meet standard BS EN 1499 for extra
						protection against harmful bacteria and contamination.</p>


					<p>
						<b>Do you use liquid soap? Do you use disposable towels? Do
							you use antibacterial soap which meets standard BS EN 1499? If
							no, what do you use?</b>
					</p>

					<h3>WHEN TO WASH YOUR HANDS</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>BEFORE touching or handling any food, especially
							ready-to-eat food (e.g. cooked meat) and AFTER touching raw meat,
							poultry, fish, eggs, unwashed vegetables or any packaging used
							for raw foods.</li>
						<li>After touching a cut or changing a dressing.</li>
						<li>When entering the kitchen e.g. after a break or going to
							the toilet.</li>
						<li>After touching items such as phones, light switches, door
							handles, cash registers and money.</li>
						<li>After touching or emptying bins. After touching your
							hair, face or blowing your nose.</li>
						<li>After any cleaning. Before preparing food for a customer
							who has declared a food allergy.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>THINK TWICE!</h3>
					<p>If you use disposable gloves in your business, they should
						never be used as an alternative to effective handwashing. When
						using disposable gloves make sure you:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Wash your hands thoroughly before putting them on and
							after taking them off.</li>
						<li>Always change them regularly, especially between handling
							raw food and ready-to-eat food.</li>
						<li>Throw them away after use or if damaged.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Hygienic hand rubs and gels can be useful when used as an
						additional precaution, but should never be used as a replacement
						for effective handwashing. If hand rubs or gels are used they
						should comply with standard BS EN 1500.</p>
					<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If you think a member of staff has not washed their
							hands, make sure they wash them straight away and emphasise how
							important it is to wash their hands when working with food.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure that hand basins are convenient with plenty of
							soap and disposable towels.</li>
						<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
						<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
					</ul>


					<h1>CLEANING EFFECTIVELY</h1>

					<p>Effective cleaning is essential to get rid of harmful
						bacteria and stop them spreading. Cleaning is also important to
						discourage pest activity.</p>



					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Cleaning and disinfection needs to be carried out in two
						stages:</p>
					<p>1. Clean: Using either hot, soapy water or a cleaning
						product (such as a sanitiser), remove visible dirt, grease and
						debris from surfaces/ equipment and wipe off or rinse.</p>
					<p>2. Disinfect: Following the manufacturer's instructions,
						apply a disinfectant (such as a sanitiser) all over the
						surfaces/equipment and leave on for the required contact time.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Chemical disinfectants only work if surfaces have been
						thoroughly cleaned first to remove grease and other dirt.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do you clean and disinfect using two stages? Have your
							staff been trained in how to complete the two stage clean? </b>
					</p>

				</label> <input type="text" class="form-control" th:field="*{test26}">
			</div>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Manufacturer's instructions/BS EN standards:</p>
					<p>When using disinfectants or sanitisers, always follow the
						manufacturer's instructions on the label. These instructions
						should tell you how to correctly dilute the product and how long
						you need to leave the product on the surface/ equipment for
						harmful bacteria to be reduced to safe levels. Sanitisers and
						disinfectants should meet relevant standards, either BS EN 1276 or
						BS EN 13697.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This is important to make sure that chemicals work
						effectively.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Where do you keep information to confirm your disinfectants
							or sanitisers meet BS EN 1276 or BS EN 13697 standards?</b>

				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>It is very important to thoroughly clean and disinfect
						surfaces and equipment after use for raw food, and before
						preparing ready-to eat foods.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This will help prevent harmful bacteria spreading from raw
						food on to ready-to-eat food.</p>


					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Regularly wash/wipe and disinfect all the items people touch
						frequently, such as work surfaces, sinks, taps, door handles,
						switches, can openers, cash registers, telephones and scales.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This will help prevent dirt and bacteria being spread to
						people's hands and then to food or other areas. Drying naturally
						helps prevent bacteria being spread back to these items on a
						towel/cloth used for drying.</p>

				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Clean and disinfect fridges regularly at a time when they do
						not contain much food. Transfer food to another fridge or a safe
						cold area and keep it covered.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>To clean a fridge thoroughly, you should take out all the
						food and keep it cold somewhere else. If food is left out at room

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Ideally use a dishwasher. Do not overload the dishwasher and
						make sure it is maintained and serviced regularly. If you do not
						have a dishwasher, wash plates, equipment, etc, in hot soapy water
						using bactericidal detergent. Ideally, separate sinks should be
						used for washing up equipment used for raw foods and equipment
						used for ready to eat foods. If you have to use the same sink, the
						water must be changed and the sink (including all taps/fittings)
						must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected using a two stage clean
						between uses.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>Dishwashers wash items thoroughly at a high temperature so
						this is a good way to clean equipment and kill bacteria
						(disinfect) and remove allergens. If you overload the dishwasher,
						it may not wash effectively. Cleaning and disinfecting is
						important to prevent bacteria spreading from raw to ready-to-eat
						food.</p>

					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
					<p>
						<b>Do you have a dishwasher? If not, do you have separate
							sinks for washing up raw and ready-to-eat equipment/utensils? If
							you only have one sink, do you clean and disinfect it (including

				<label>

					<h3>OTHER CLEANING</h3>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Items that do not touch food are not as high a priority but
						they should still be cleaned effectively. Examples include dry
						storage areas and floors. Take care when cleaning floors so other
						surfaces are not contaminated by splashing.</p>
					<p>For equipment or areas that are hard to clean, you may wish
						to employ a contract cleaner.</p>
					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This prevents dirt and bacteria building up in the kitchen.
						It also removes any food which has fallen on the floor, which can
						attract pests e.g. mice and cockroaches. Contract cleaners have
						special equipment and experience of more difficult cleaning.</p>
					<p>THINK TWICE!</p>
					<p>Effective cleaning needs to be carried out in two stages.
						Disinfectants will only work on clean surfaces. Always use a
						cleaning product to remove visible dirt and grease before
						disinfecting. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for the
						correct dilution and contact time for disinfectants or sanitisers.</p>
					<p>When you are cleaning, remember to move food out of the way
						or cover it and to change your protective clothing. This is to
						prevent dirt, bacteria or cleaning chemicals from getting onto
						food.</p>



					<p>MANAGE IT:</p>
					<p>Fill out the cleaning schedule in the diary to show how you
						manage cleaning in your business. (See the 'Your cleaning
						schedule' safe method.)</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>This is to make sure that staff know what to clean, when and
						how.</p>

					<h1>SAFE METHOD:</h1>
					<h3>CLEAR AND CLEAN AS YOU GO</h3>
					<p>Keeping your kitchen clear and clean makes it safer.</p>
					<p>It is a good idea to take off outer packaging from food
						before you bring food into the kitchen or storeroom. Remember to
						check if allergen information is on the inner packaging before
						disposing of the outer packaging so you can provide accurate
						information to your customers. Outer packaging could have touched
						dirty floors etc. when it has been stored or transported before.</p>
					<p>Take extra care with how you throw away packaging and food
						waste from raw food. If packaging from raw food touches work
						surfaces make sure you wash and then disinfect them afterwards.
						Packaging and food waste from these foods are more likely to
						spread harmful bacteria and allergens to food and surfaces.</p>
					<p>Keep your kitchen free from clutter and rubbish. Clear away
						dirty kitchen equipment as soon as possible. Work surfaces are
						easier to keep clean when they are not cluttered. It is also
						important to clear away used equipment to prevent bacteria and
						allergens spreading from it to surfaces or food.</p>
					<p>Keep sinks clear and clean them regularly. This stops dirt
						building up and helps prevent bacteria and allergens from
						spreading.</p>
					<p>Wash or wipe away spills as soon as they happen. Clean and
						then disinfect work surfaces after wiping up spills from raw food.
						This stops dirt building up and helps prevent bacteria and
						allergens from spreading.</p>
					<p>Wash work surfaces thoroughly between tasks. Use a new cloth
						(or one that has been washed and disinfected) to clean work
						surfaces before preparing ready-to-eat food. This will help
						prevent dirt and bacteria and allergens spreading onto other foods
						from the surface. A dirty cloth could spread bacteria and
						allergens to the surface.</p>

					<p>SAFE METHOD:</p>
					<p>YOUR CLEANING SCHEDULE</p>
					<p>A cleaning schedule is a useful tool to help you clean
						effectively in your business.</p>
					<p>WHAT TO DO</p>
					<p>You can use the cleaning schedule supplied in the diary to
						write down how you clean in your business. This safe method should
						help you do this. Alternatively, you may already have a cleaning
						schedule. If so, you can continue to use it, but it is a good idea
						to look at this safe method and review your schedule to make sure
						that it covers the right things.</p>
					<p>It is important to write down how you do your cleaning, so
						you can show what you do. It is also useful for staff to be able
						to check how they should clean things, so you may wish to put your
						cleaning schedule on the wall.</p>
					<p>SAFETY POINT</p>
					<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?</p>
					<p>Walk through your premises and make a list of a list of
						everything that needs cleaning. This will depend on what you do in
						your business. Some items should be cleaned more frequently than
						others and some should also be disinfected. You do not need to
						disinfect everything – concentrate on those items that will be
						touched by food and frequently touched items such as door handles.</p>

					<p>You will also need to clean and then disinfect surfaces or
						items that have been touched by raw food, or leaks or spills from
						these. Some specialist equipment will have instructions on
						dismantling and cleaning which should be followed.</p>
					<p>See the next page of this safe method. You may find it
						helpful to go through the following examples of items that need
						cleaning and disinfecting:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Items that come into contact with food
							<ul>
								<li>Work surfaces and chopping boards</li>
								<li>Equipment e.g. knives</li>
								<li>Fridges and freezers</li>
								<li>Equipment with moving parts e.g. food mixers, slicers,
									vacuum packing machines and processors</li>
								<li>Sinks and soap dispensers</li>
								<li>Re-usable cloths and work clothes</li>
								<li>Ice machines</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Frequently touched items
							<ul>
								<li>Rubbish bins, broom and mop handles</li>
								<li>Door handles, taps, switches, controls, cash registers
									and scales</li>
								<li>Can openers, telephones, probe thermometers</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Other items
							<ul>
								<li>Floors, walls, ceilings</li>
								<li>Storage areas</li>
								<li>Waste areas and drains</li>
								<li>Microwaves, ovens, dishwashers, hot-holding and display
									cabinets</li>
								<li>Self-service and staff areas</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For each item, or group of items, write down what you do on
						your cleaning schedule. Include details on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How you clean the item(s)</li>
						<li>What chemicals you use and how to use them</li>
						<li>What equipment you use</li>
						<li>How often you clean the item(s)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Review your schedule regularly and check that all cleaning
						is being done properly. Train staff on the cleaning schedule, so
						they know what they have to do, and when. Supervise cleaning.</p>

					<h1>CHILLING</h1>

					<p>Chilling food properly helps to stop harmful bacteria from
						growing.
					<p>
					<h3>CHILLED STORAGE AND DISPLAYING CHILLED FOOD</h3>

					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Certain foods need to be kept chilled to keep them safe, for
						example:</p>
					<p>food with a 'use by' date</p>
					<p>food that says 'keep refrigerated' on the label</p>
					<p>food you have cooked and will not serve immediately</p>
					<p>ready-to-eat food such as salads, cooked meats, sandwiches
						and desserts.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>
					<p>If these types of food are not kept cold enough harmful
						bacteria could grow.</p>

			<div class="form-group">
				<label>
					<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
					<p>Make sure you use food before its 'use by' date. For dishes
						you have prepared or cooked, use stickers, or another method of
						labelling, to keep track of when food should be used or thrown
						away. For guidance on how long to keep food, follow manufacturer's
						storage instructions on the product label. High risk ready to eat
						foods should be kept for a maximum of 3 days in total (day of
						cook/ opening + 2) unless you have evidence that it is safe to
						keep them for longer.</p>

					<p>WHY?:</p>

						<h3>THINK TWICE!</h3>
						<p>When you display cold food (e.g. on a buffet) you should
							use suitable chilled display equipment to keep it at 8C or below.
							If this is not possible there is a '4 hour rule' exception: You
							can display food out of chilled storage for up to four hours, but
							you can only do this once.</p>
						<p>Make sure you know how long food has been on display or
							kept out of chilled storage. It is a good idea to label foods
							with the time they were taken out of the fridge or write this
							information in your diary so you can check the time easily. Food
							which has been displayed for less than four hours can be put back
							in the fridge and kept at 8C or below until it is used. If it has
							been out for more than four hours it must be thrown away.</p>
						<p>If you do take food out of chilled storage to display it,
							remove a small amount at a time. Make sure that food on display
							is used up before you add new food. This will make it easier to
							ensure that food is not left on display longer than 4 hours.</p>
						<p>Some foods require storage at temperatures lower than 8C to
							keep them safe so always follow the manufacturer's storage
							guidance.</p>
						<p>Minimise the time chilled foods are kept out at room
							temperature during preparation. You can help do this by only
							preparing small batches one at a time.</p>

						<h4>PROVE IT</h4>
						<p>To check chilling equipment is working effectively you can
							use a disinfected temperature probe to check the food is kept at
							a safe temperature. (See the 'Prove it' safe method in the
							Management section for advice on using probes safely).</p>
						<h4>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h4>
						<p>• If your fridge or display equipment breaks down, use
							other equipment, or move the food to a cold area. If you cannot
							do this, or you do not know how long the equipment has been
							broken down, contact the Environmental Health Team at your local
							council for advice.</p>
						<p>• If food on display has not been kept chilled for more
							than four hours, throw it away.</p>
						<p>Remember that some foods need extra care e.g. rice. See the

						<h1>CHILLING DOWN HOT FOOD</h1>
						<p>Harmful bacteria can grow in food that is not chilled down
							as quickly as possible.</p>
						<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
						<p>If you have cooked food that you will not serve
							immediately, chill it down as quickly as possible and then put it
							in the fridge. Avoid cooking large quantities of food in advance,
							unless you need to.</p>

						<p>WHY?:</p>
						<p>Harmful bacteria can grow in food that is left to chill
							slowly. Large quantities of food are more difficult to chill down
							quickly, especially solid food.</p>

						<p>OPTIONS FOR CHILLING DOWN FOOD (YOU CAN USE ONE OR MORE OF
							THESE) -> WHY?</p>
						<p>Divide food into smaller portions. -> Smaller amounts of
							food chill down more quickly.</p>
						<p>Cut joints of meat in half. -> Smaller pieces of meat will
							cool more quickly</p>
						<p>Cover pans of hot food and move them to a colder area, e.g.
							a storage room, or stand them in cold water. You can also also
							use ice to speed up chilling. ->This will make the food chill
							more quickly.</p>
						<p>Stir food regularly while it is chilling down. -> Stirring
							helps food chill more evenly.</p>
						<p>Spread food out on a tray e.g. rice. -> Spreading the food
							out will help it cool more quickly.</p>
						<p>If you have a 'cool' setting on your oven, use it to chill
							down food. -> Some ovens have a 'cool' setting, which can help to
							chill down food by increasing the air flow around it. (The oven
							should be cool first.)</p>
						<p>Use a blast chiller to chill down food. -> A blast chiller
							is specially designed to chill down hot foods quickly and safely.

						<h3>PROVE IT</h3>
						<p>If you would like to compare different chilling options,
							try them out with the same food. You will only need to do this
							once.</p>
						<p>When you have just cooked the food, use a probe to test its
							temperature. (See the 'Prove it' method in the Management section
							for advice on using probes safely.) Then test the temperature
							again at regular intervals to find out how fast the food is being
							chilled down. Remember to use a clean probe each time you check
							the food.</p>
						<p>Repeat the process with different chilling options to find
							out which is most effective.</p>
						<h3>What to do if things go wrong</h3>
						<p>If food has not been chilled down safely, re-cook it, if
							appropriate, or throw it away. Remember that some foods need
							extra care e.g. rice. See the safe method 'Foods that need extra
							care' in the Cooking section.</p>
						<h3>How to stop this happening again</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Review your chilling methods to make sure they are
								working properly. If appropriate, try out different methods and
								choose the one that best meets your needs.</li>
							<li>Make sure you always allow enough time and make portions
								small enough.</li>
							<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
							<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
							<li>If you chill down lots of hot food in your business you
								may wish to consider using a blast chiller.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Write down what went wrong and what you did about it in

						<h1>DEFROSTING</h1>
						<p>Harmful bacteria can grow in food that is not defrosted
							properly.</p>

						<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
						<p>Food should be thoroughly defrosted before cooking (unless
							the manufacturer's instructions tell you to cook from frozen or
							you have a proven safe method).</p>

						<p>WHY?:</p>
						<p>If food is still frozen or partially frozen, it will take
							longer to cook. The outside of the food could be cooked, but the
							centre might not be, which means it could contain harmful
							bacteria.</p>

						<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
						<p>
							<b> Do you check food is thoroughly defrosted before cooking?
								If not, what do you do? </b>
						</p>

						<h3>OPTIONS FOR DEFROSTING FOOD</h3>
						<p>1. Ideally, plan ahead to leave enough time and space to
							defrost small amounts of food in the fridge. Putting food in the
							fridge will keep it at a safe temperature while it is defrosting.
						</p>
						<p>2. If you cannot defrost food in the fridge, you could put
							it in a container and then place it under cold running water.
							Cold water will help to speed up defrosting without allowing the
							outside of the food to get too warm.</p>
						<p>3. Raw mea t and poultry (including large joints and whole
							birds), should not be defrosted under cold running water unless
							they are in a sealed container. For more information visit the
							FSA website. Harmful bacteria could be spread, contaminating
							sinks, taps and surfaces.</p>
						<p>4. If you use the sink to defrost some foods, make sure the
							sink is clean and empty. The sink should be cleaned and then
							disinfected after being used for defrosting. Cold running water
							will help speed up defrosting.</p>
						<p>5. Or you could defrost food in the microwave on the
							'defrost' setting. This is a fast way to defrost food.</p>
						<p>6. If necessary you could defrost food at room temperature.
							Follow the manufacturer's defrosting instructions. Food should be
							left out at room temperature for the shortest time possible.
							Ideally, defrost these foods in the fridge. Foods will defrost
							quite quickly at room temperature, but harmful bacteria could
							grow in food if it gets too warm while defrosting.</p>

						<p>
							<b> Which method do you use? Which foods do you defrost in
								this way? If you have another method of defrosting, also write
								the details here: </b>

					<label>
						<p>THINK TWICE!</p>
						<p>Keep meat/poultry separate from other food when it is
							defrosting, to prevent cross-contamination. Once food has been
							defrosted you should use it immediately (within one day).</p>


						<p>CHECK IT:</p>
						<p>When you think food has defrosted, it is important to check
							to make sure.</p>
						<p>WHY?:</p>
						<p>The outside may look defrosted but the inside could still
							be frozen.</p>


						<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
						<p>
							<b>Check for ice crystals in the food using your hand or a
								skewer. With birds, check the joints are flexible. Do you use
								this checks? If you use another checks, write the details. </b>
						</p>

				<div class="form-group">
					<label>
						<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>If food has not fully defrosted, continue to defrost the
								food until no ice crystals are left. Test again before cooking
								or reheating.</li>
							<li>Speed up the defrosting process e.g. by using cold water
								or a microwave (see the front of this sheet).</li>
							<li>Use an alternative menu item. If you do not have time to
								defrost for longer, replace the dish with a similar dish that is
								ready to serve.</li>
						</ul>
						<h1>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Change your defrosting method and make it safer, e.g.
								defrost smaller amounts.</li>
							<li>Make sure you allow enough time to defrost.</li>
							<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
							<li>Improve staff supervision.</li>
							<li>If you defrost lots of food in your business you may
								wish to consider creating extra fridge space or using a special
								defrosting cabinet.</li>
						</ul>


						<h1>FREEZING</h1>
						<p>It is important to take care when freezing food and handle
							frozen food safely.</p>

						<h3>THINK TWICE!</h3>
						<p>Once the food is defrosted it's shelf life depends on the
							amount of days left until expiry when it was frozen down.</p>
						<h1>PROVE IT</h1>
						<p>You can use the digital display, a dial thermometer or a
							probe thermometer to check your freezer is keeping food at a safe
							temperature. (See the 'Prove it' pages in the Management section
							for advice on using probes safely).</p>
						<h3>WHAT TO DO IF THINGS GO WRONG</h3>
						<p>If you find that your freezer is not working properly, you
							should do the following things:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Food that is still frozen (i.e. hard and icy) should be
								moved to an alternative freezer straight away. If there is no
								alternative freezer, defrost food using the 'Defrosting' safe
								method.</li>
							<li>Food that has begun to defrost (i.e. starting to get
								soft and/or with liquid coming out of it) should be moved to a
								suitable place to continue defrosting using the 'Defrosting'
								safe method.</li>
							<li>Fully defrosted food (i.e. soft and warm) should be
								cooked, if appropriate (e.g. raw meat and poultry), until it is
								piping hot all the way through. After cooking, use the food
								immediately or chill or freeze it safely straight away. If this
								is not possible, throw it away.</li>
							<li>Food that has to be kept frozen (e.g. ice cream) cannot
								be re-frozen once it has started to defrost. You will have to
								use it immediately or throw it away.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Remember, some foods need extra care. See the 'Foods that
							need extra care' safe method in the Cooking section.</p>
						<h3>HOW TO STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Get your freezer mended or buy a new one.</li>
							<li>Have freezers serviced regularly and check that they are
								working properly as part of your opening checks.</li>
							<li>Re-organise freezers so there is more space and they are
								kept closed as much as possible.</li>
							<li>Train staff again on this safe method.</li>
							<li>Increase staff supervision.</li>
						</ul>


						<p>SAFETY POINT:</p>
						<p>Put frozen food in the freezer as soon as it is delivered.
							If you are freezing fresh food, freeze it as soon as it has been
							delivered or prepared. Freeze hot food as soon as it has been
							properly chilled down. Divide food into smaller portions and put
							it in containers or freezer bags before freezing.</p>

						<p>WHY?:</p>
						<p>If frozen food starts to defrost, harmful bacteria could
							grow. The longer you wait before freezing food, the greater the
							chance of harmful bacteria growing. (See the 'Chilling down hot
							food' method.) Smaller portions will freeze (and defrost) more
							quickly. The centre of larger portions takes longer to freeze,
							allowing harmful bacteria to grow. Using containers and freezer
							bags prevents crosscontamination.</p>

						<p>HOW DO YOU DO THIS?:</p>
						<p>
							<b>Is frozen food put in the freezer as soon as it is
								delivered? Is fresh and cooked food put in the freezer as soon
								as it has been delivered, prepared, or chilled down? Is food
								divided into smaller portions to help it freeze better? Is
								frozen food stored in containers or freezer bags? If you
								answered 'No' to any of the above questions, write down what you
								do: </b>
